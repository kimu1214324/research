</font>

<p>In today's society, the use of technology and the internet has become common among people of all ages. <br>
 Online gaming, in particular, has become increasingly popular among adolescents, with more and more students spending their leisure time playing many online games. <br>
 While online gaming can provide entertainment and socialization, there is growing concern about its possible negative impact on academic performance. <br>
 This study aims to explore the relationship between online gaming and academic performance among Grade 10 students of GBMHS. <br>
According to a study conducted by the American Psychological Association, excessive gaming can lead to poor academic performance, lower grades, and decreased academic motivation (Gentile et al., 2011). <br>
 Another study found that students who spend more time on social media and online gaming are more likely to have lower grades (Judd & Kennedy, 2011).
 These findings highlight the need to investigate the effect of online gaming on academic performance. <br>
 In the Philippines, a study conducted by the Department of Education found that there is a high prevalence of internet use among students, with 81% of students using the internet at least once a week (DepEd, 2019). <br>
 In addition, the study found that online gaming is one of the most famous internet activities among students. <br>
 With the increasing prevalence of online gaming among Filipino students, it is crucial to investigate its impact on academic perform <br>
 While there have been some studies on the relationship between online gaming and academic performance, most of these studies have been conducted in Western countries. <br>
 There is a lack of research on this topic in the Philippines, particularly among Grade 10 students. <br>
 This study seeks to fill this research gap by investigating the effect of online gaming on academic performance among Grade 10 students of GBMHS. <br>
 Gil B. Manalo High School (GBMHS) is a public a high school in the Philippines. The school recognizes the importance of balancing academic excellence with the development of students’ social and emotional skills. <br>
 This study aligns with the school’s goals by investigating the possible effect of online gaming on academic performance. <br>
 The findings of this study can have significant implications for parents, educators, and policymakers. By studying the relationship between online gaming and academic performance, parents and educators can better guide students in managing their online gaming habits. <br>
 Policymakers can also use the findings to develop guidelines and policies that promote responsible online gaming among students. Finally, this study can contribute to creating a healthier and more productive learning environment for students. <br></p>

<h6> Theoretical Framework </h6>

     <p>The theoretical framework for this study is based on the Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977) which posits that people learn through observation, imitation, and modeling of behavior from others. <br>
     In this case, the theory suggests that online gaming habits of Grade 10 students may be influenced by the behavior of their peers and the norms within their social group. <br></p>

<h7> Hypothesis of the Study </h7>

     <p>H1: There is a significant relationship between online gaming involvement and academic performance among Grade 10 students of GBMHS. <br><br>
     H2: Factors such as peer pressure, parental control, and internet accessibility significantly influence the online gaming habits of Grade 10 students at Gil B. Manalo High School. <br><br></p>

<h8> Chapter 2: Review of Related Literature </h8>

     <p>Online gaming is an increasingly popular leisure activity among young people. It provides entertainment and a means of social interaction, but it has also been associated with negative consequences such as addiction, poor academic performance, and social isolation. <br>
     This literature review aims to examine the relationship between online gaming and academic performance among Grade 10 students of GBMHS, as well as the factors influencing online gaming habits. <br></p>

<h9> Extent of Online Gaming Involvement: </h9>

     <p>A study conducted by Lenhart et al. (2008) found that 97% of American teenagers aged 12 to 17 play video games, and 50% of them play games online. Similarly, a study by Wang et al. (2018) found that 88.8% of Chinese adolescents aged 10 to 19 play video games, and 64.3% of them play games online.<br>
     These findings suggest that online gaming is a prevalent activity among young people, and Grade 10 students of GBMHS are likely to be involved in it as well. <br></p>

<h10> Academic Performance: </h10>

     <p>Several studies have investigated the relationship between online gaming and academic performance. A study by Gentile et al. (2011) found that excessive gaming was associated with poorer academic performance, lower grades, and lower standardized test scores. <br>
     Similarly, a study by Chen et al. (2018) found that high levels of online gaming were negatively associated with academic achievement among Chinese adolescents. These findings suggest that online gaming may have a negative impact on academic performance. <br></p>

<h11> Factors Influencing Online Gaming Habits: </h11>

     <p>Several factors have been identified as influencing online gaming habits among young people. A study by Van Rooij et al. (2014) found that psychological factors such as impulsivity, sensation seeking, and social anxiety were associated with problematic gaming behavior. <br>
     Similarly, a study by Wang et al. (2018) found that social factors such as peer influence and social support were predictors of online gaming behavior. These findings suggest that online gaming habits are influenced by a variety of factors, including psychological and social factors. <br></p>

<h12> Relationship between Online Gaming and Academic Performance: </h12>

     <p>Several studies have investigated the relationship between online gaming and academic performance. <br>
     A study by Lei and Wu (2007) found that excessive gaming was associated with lower academic achievement among Chinese adolescents. Similarly, a study by Dindar and Orhan (2011) found that excessive gaming was negatively correlated with academic performance among Turkish high school students. These findings suggest that online gaming may have a negative impact on academic performance. <br>
     In conclusion, online gaming is a prevalent activity among young people, including Grade 10 students of GBMHS. Excessive gaming has been found to be associated with poor academic performance and lower grades. <br>
     Online gaming habits are influenced by psychological and social factors such as impulsivity, sensation seeking, peer influence, and social support. Therefore, it is essential to address the negative impact of online gaming on academic performance among Grade 10 students of GBMHS, while also taking into account the underlying factors that influence their gaming habits. <br></p>
